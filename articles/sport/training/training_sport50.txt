This is an opinion column.

This isn’t the column I planned to pen, not from beginning to end, but Auburn, even in disarray, has a habit of providing a story as compelling as Alabama’s in the most unusual ways.

Auburn-Texas A&M wasn’t the game I planned to watch with more than a passing interest because the dignity of the Alabama dynasty was on the line at Ole Miss, but Jordan-Hare after dark is a marvelous environment for crazy.

It happened again Saturday. Go Crazy was the plan, in honor of interim coach Carnell Williams and his endless enthusiasm. The Auburn family, after more than a year of misery, fully understood the assignment and was thrilled to comply.

Players and coaches, fans and alums came together to deliver an experience all out of proportion to what was at stake. A bargain basement bonanza between the two worst teams in the SEC West became the most moving struggle between 3-6 teams in the history of college football.

It was a deep-fried, laser-eyed light show. It was a unified show of force from a family that’s been far too fractured far too often. It was a 13-10 mud-wrestling match of a victory they celebrated almost as if it were another Kick Six.
