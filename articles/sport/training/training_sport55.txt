Florida football hosted the South Carolina Gamecocks for its final home game of the 2022 season and came away with a decisive 38-6 victory on Senior Day. The two Southeastern Conference East Division rivals were expected to battle it out on Ben Hill Griffin Stadiumâ€™s turf but the matchup ended up being a blowout after the Gators ran off to an early 24-0 lead.

This one was all about the running game, which kicked into high gear in the first quarter and never let off the gas. Two Gators finished with 100 yards or more on the ground while a third fell just four yards short of the mark. The Orange and Blue also managed to go almost the entire game without coughing up the ball, but unfortunately, it came loose with less than two minutes remaining in the game and the Gamecocks recovered.

The Gators Wire gang quickly convened after the end of the game to give its collective takes on what they saw on the field in Gainesville on Saturday. Take a look below at how each member of the crew interpreted the outcome of the huge road win and what it means for Florida as the season quickly comes to a close.
