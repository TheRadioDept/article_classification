Red Sox chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom made an out-of-nowhere trade last offseason, acquiring Jackie Bradley Jr. from the Brewers one year after letting him walk in free agency.

Reacquiring Bradley didn’t work out. The Red Sox eventually designated him for assignment. But Bloom took a chance on a player he had familiarity with.

Might Bloom again this offseason reacquire one of his former players?

Here are 10 former Red Sox who are available in free agency:

1. Christian Vázquez: Boston traded the 32-year-old catcher to the Astros on Aug. 1. He struggled offensively with Houston and finished the 2022 season with a .274/.315/.399/.714 line, nine homers, 23 doubles, 41 runs and 52 RBIs in 119 games (426 plate appearances).

The New York Post’s Jon Heyman listed the Red Sox as one of eight teams that might target Vázquez this offseason (the Rays also are listed). Heyman ran contract projections and has Vázquez projected to receive three years, $33 million ($11 million average annual value).

Our Chris Cotillo wrote why Vázquez’s struggles with Houston might make a reunion with the Red Sox more likely.

Reese McGuire, who Boston acquired from the White Sox right after trading Vázquez, slashed .337/.377/.500/.877 in 36 games (108 plate appearances) with the Red Sox.

Chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom has said he would feel comfortable with a 2023 catching duo of McGuire and Connor Wong. But Bloom also said the Red Sox “are going to explore additions” at catcher this offseason.

2. Andrew Benintendi: The Red Sox traded the left fielder to the Royals before the 2021 season. He has batted .289 with a .348 on-base percentage, .421 slugging percentage, .770 OPS, 22 homers, 50 doubles, five triples, 124 RBIs and 117 runs in 260 games (1,059 plate appearances) the past two seasons with the Royals and Yankees. Of his 277 hits, 199 have been singles (72%) and so that’s concerning.

The 28-year-old was an All-Star in 2022 and a Gold Glove winner in 2021 (9 defensive runs saved the past two seasons).

The Red Sox need to add an outfielder this offseason. Heyman has Boston as one of five teams that might target Benintendi (Yankees also included). Heyman also ran expert contract projection and has Benintendi projected to receive four years, $56 million ($14 million average annual value).

3-4. Adam Ottavino and Chris Martin: Masslive.com listed both Ottavino and Martin among the 25 relievers who the Red Sox could pursue this offseason. Heyman has the Red Sox as one of four teams along with the Mets, Rockies and Phillies who could pursue Ottavino.

Ottavino will turn 37 later this month. The righty finished the 2022 season with a 2.06 ERA and 0.97 WHIP while holding opponents to a .204 batting average in 66 outings (65 ⅔ innings). The biggest difference for him in 2022 was improved command. He averaged only 2.2 walks per nine innings, down from 5.1 walks per nine innings with Boston in 2021 and 3.9 BB/9 for his career.

Martin, meanwhile, never pitched for Boston but he spent three seasons (2011-13) in the Red Sox minor league system and made it all the way to then-Triple-A Pawtucket.

Boston traded him with Franklin Morales to the Rockies for Jonathan Herrera on Dec. 18, 2013.

The 36-year-old righty struck out 34 and walked just one batter in 24 ⅔ innings after being traded midseason to the Dodgers in 2022. He finished this past season with a 3.05 ERA, 0.98 WHIP, 74 strikeouts and five walks in 60 outings (56 innings). He threw his four-seam fastball 42.5%, averaging 95.3 mph and holding opponents to a .146 batting average with it, per Baseball Savant.

5. José Iglesias: If the Red Sox fail to re-sign free agent Xander Bogaerts, Iglesias is an option. Iglesias, who will turn 33 in January, had a solid season for the Rockies in 2022. He batted .292 with a .328 on-base percentage, 30 doubles and three triples in 118 games (467 plate appearances). He also was very good in September 2021 (.356/.406/.508/.915, 64 plate appearances) with Boston. Iglesias, who had negative-4 defensive runs saved at shortstop in ‘22, would be an option at either shortstop or second base.

MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand reported that the Red Sox are calling teams to check on the availability of their second basemen in case Bogaerts leaves, although Bloom called the report as “overblown.” In that scenario, Trevor Story would move to shortstop. So the Red Sox also could sign Iglesias and play him at second.

There are obviously much better options, including Bogaerts, Dansby Swanson, Carlos Correa and Trea Turner, on the free agent market. Signing Iglesias, a much cheaper option, presumably wouldn’t go over well with fans (and it shouldn’t) but it could be an alternative if Bogaerts doesn’t sign and the Red Sox can’t land one of the other top shortstops.

6. Wade Miley: It’s been a long time since Miley and then-manager John Farrell got in a heated dugout exchange when Farrell removed the lefty from a game in June 2015. The argument led to Dennis Eckersley’s famous “You just got your lunch” line.

Miley, who turned 36 today, has gone 33-20 with a 3.50 ERA in 92 outings (89 starts) since the start of 2018. He posted a 3.37 ERA in 28 starts for Cincinnati in 2021. He was limited to just nine games and eight starts in 2022 (3.16 ERA) because of a left shoulder strain.

If he’s healthy, he could be a solid addition as a depth starter in 2023.

7. Martín Pérez: MassLive.com ran a list of 20 potential starting pitching targets who Boston could pursue this offseason. Pérez was listed.

As mentioned in that story, Pérez enjoyed his two years with Boston (2020-21) but he also lost his starting rotation spot during the 2021 season after having a 4.77 ERA in 22 starts.

He obviously turned it around in Texas in 2022. He made the All-Star team and finished with a 2.89 ERA in 32 starts. Heyman has the Red Sox as one of the teams that might pursue Pérez but it seems unlikely, especially now with him tied to a qualifying offer. Texas extended him a $19.65 million qualifying offer, meaning the Red Sox would have to give up draft pick compensation to sign him.

8. Craig Kimbrel: The 34-year-old finished the 2022 season with a 3.75 ERA, 1.32 WHIP and .227 batting average against in 63 games (60 innings) for Los Angeles. He converted 22-of-27 save opportunities. He had a 3.10 ERA, 1.17 WHIP and .196 batting average against in 30 outings during the second half. But the Dodgers left him off their ALDS roster.

9. Erasmo Ramirez: Anyone who remembers Ramirez pitching for the Red Sox deserves a fan of the year award. He appeared in one game for the 2019 Red Sox, allowing four runs in three innings. The 32-year-old righty had a pretty good season for the Nationals in 2022, posting a 2.92 ERA and 1.08 WHIP in 60 relief outings. Bloom is familiar with him as they were together in Tampa Bay from 2015-17. He’s a low-risk option who wouldn’t cost much.

10. David Price: This isn’t going to happen as Price didn’t love his time in Boston and he is considering retirement. But why shouldn’t the Red Sox be interested in the lefty who helped lead them to the 2018 World Series? He has been a pretty solid reliever the past two years with the Dodgers. He posted a 2.45 ERA in 40 relief outings in 2022.
