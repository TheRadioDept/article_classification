University of Wisconsin quarterback Graham Mertz got hit pretty hard Saturday.

On and off the field.

The junior had a very long afternoon at Kinnick Stadium as the Badgers fell to Iowa, 24-10.

He was just 16 of 35 for 176 yards and a 24.4 passer rating. He had two interceptions and one lost fumble. One interception was returned for a touchdown. Mertz was also sacked four times.
