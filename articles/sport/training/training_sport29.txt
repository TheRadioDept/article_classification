A season’s worth of frustration was released into the biting autumn air in Auburn.

For the first time since Sept. 24 against Missouri, Auburn was victorious. Auburn defeated Texas A&M, 13-10, Saturday night at Jordan-Hare Stadium, snapping a five-game losing streak and handing Texas A&M its sixth straight loss in the process. It also marked the first career win for interim coach Cadillac Williams on what was a surreal night on the Plains.

Cadillac Williams gets emotional after first Auburn win: Auburn “ain’t dead”

Auburn is still 4-6 overall and 2-5 in SEC play, trying to claw its way back to respectability after the unceremonious end to the Bryan Harsin era. There’s still work to be done, which players acknowledged after the game, but for one night at least, joy returned to Jordan-Hare Stadium. For Jimbo Fisher’s team, though, a nightmare season continued as Texas A&M fell to 3-7 overall and 1-6 in SEC action.
