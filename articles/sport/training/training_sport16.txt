Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is active and will start Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings despite an ulnar collateral ligament injury in his right elbow

Bills officials had been tight-lipped all week about his status and wanted to keep it secret until after Sunday's NFL actives/inactives list was released. Bills officials spent a lot of time this past week leaning on the advice of their doctors and other arm specialists, and the team was reassured that Allen is not at risk to make the injury worse if he plays Sunday against the Vikings, sources said.

Cornerback Tre'Davious White is inactive for a second straight game while on the active roster and healthy as the Bills continue to take his return from a torn ACL slowly.

Allen was limited in Friday's practice, when he was seen with a practice jersey on and no sleeve on his right arm. He has participated in only one day of practice after sitting out Wednesday and Thursday.

"We are literally in an hour-to-hour situation here just looking at how he's going to progress through the day," coach Sean McDermott said Friday. "And as he goes through these different tests, medically, making sure that he's able to check the boxes in a progression to where we can see if we can proceed through the course of the day here."

Allen sustained the injury on the last drive of last Sunday's loss to the New York Jets. He has not missed a game since 2018, when he missed four games with another UCL injury in his right elbow.

Allen has accounted for 82% of the Bills' total yardage and 92% of the offense's touchdowns, both highest in the league.
