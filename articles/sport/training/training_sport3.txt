The Seahawks offense has mostly been a shipwreck today in Munich. Geno Smith and Tyler Lockett have finally gotten them into the end zone, though.

Watch Smith move his feet and then find Lockett for six.

The two-point attempt afterwards failed, so the Bucs lead 21-9 with just 8:20 to go in the fourth quarter.
