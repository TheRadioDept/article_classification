4 p.m. ET games

Offense

Kyler Murray, QB, ARI: Hamstring -- Questionable

Impact: It's looking to be a game-time call, with Colt McCoy getting ready to jump into the proverbial saddle.

Matt Prater, K, ARI: Hip -- Questionable

Impact: He didn't travel with the team, and the Cardinals have signed Tristan Vizcaino.

Ezekiel Elliott, RB, DAL: Knee -- Questionable

Impact: Tony Pollard is a safer play, as a decision on Elliott likely will not be made until the last minute.

Romeo Doubs, WR, GB: Ankle -- OUT

Impact: Sammy Watkins and Christian Watson get bumps in fantasy value.

Deon Jackson, RB, IND: Knee -- OUT

Impact: Jordan Wilkins and Zack Moss will back up Jonathan Taylor.

Mo Alie-Cox, TE, IND: Ankle -- Questionable

Impact: If you want to add Kylen Granson, I guess there's nobody stopping you.

Matthew Stafford, QB, LAR: Concussion -- Questionable

Impact: John Wolford is getting ready to start, as Stafford still has to clear the league's protocol.

Defense

Dennis Gardeck, LB, ARI: Ankle -- Questionable

Budda Baker, S, ARI: Ankle -- Questionable

Byron Murphy Jr., CB, ARI: Back -- Questionable

Anthony Barr, LB, DAL: Hamstring -- OUT

Sunday night game

Impact: DeAndre Carter will start in this one.

Mike Williams, WR, LAC: Ankle -- OUT

Dustin Hopkins, K, LAC: Hamstring -- OUT

Impact: Time for Cameron Dicker, which rhymes with kicker.

Samson Ebukam, DE, SF: Quad -- Doubtful

Arik Armstead, DT, SF: Foot -- OUT

9:30 a.m. ET game

Marquise Goodwin, WR, SEA: Groin -- Active

Impact: He was able to practice in full on Friday, which bodes well for his chances at success today.

Russell Gage, WR, TB: Hamstring -- OUT

Impact: Julio Jones gets to join Mike Evans and Chris Godwin in 3-WR sets.

Cameron Brate, TE, TB: Neck -- Active

Impact: He practiced all week long, so he might finally be ready to take his No. 1 TE job back.

Impact: Kendall Hinton should be the team's No. 3 WR this week.

Josh Reynolds, WR, DET: Back -- OUT

Impact: Kalif Raymond gets another chance to try to make some offensive noise, but he's been very quiet thus far.

Impact: It still remains to be seen whether all is forgiven after his recent comments.

Nico Collins, WR, HOU: Groin -- Active

Impact: He certainly should be in the flex conversation.
