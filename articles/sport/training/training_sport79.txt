Why is your team so resilient?

"I don't know. You go back and we were so disappointed last year. We looked at every little thing that we lost from the Orange Bowl team to last year's team and we tried to touch everything to get better -- from leadership to discipline to toughness, to attitude to being a team guy instead of an individual. I just feel like this team has all pulled that together. They're a team that really likes each other. We talk about culture, we talk about chemistry, all of that's really good with this team. We've had very little problems with any of them and that's just positive, and it's hard to do. It sounds easy, but it's really hard to do.

"Even next year, we'll have a lot of great players coming back. But we've got to start over, we can't expect it to happen and that's when you get in trouble. I think after the Orange Bowl team, I think we expected it to be okay and it wasn't okay. That's why coaching is so hard because you have to start over every week, every game, every day, but you sure have to start over every year. Because it's not like the NFL. You don't have the same players and the dynamics and your leadership, everything changes."
