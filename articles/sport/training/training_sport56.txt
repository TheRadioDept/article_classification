On where it started to go wrong

"First quarter, I don’t know what it was, but we couldn't stop them and we couldn't stay on the field in the first quarter. I think they scored on the first three possessions, if I am not mistaken. They scored the first three times they touched the ball and we couldn’t stay on the field. They went up and down the field on us in the first quarter and we weren't able to stay on the field as well. Having said that, we got some points before the half and felt, as ugly as the first half was, we felt good. We told the players all week, it is going to be tough. It was is one of the great environments in all of college football. It is going to be hard. Just keep swinging and get this thing to the fourth quarter and let’s go find a way to win in the fourth quarter. When you go out on offense in the third quarter and go turnover, turnover, turnover in what, three plays, four plays. I don’t know if I have ever seen that. State semifinal my senior year in high school, we fumbled it the first two times we touched it. Kickoff return and the first play of offense to start the game. To go four plays and three turnovers, completely unacceptable. Florida leads the SEC in turnover margin, you see why. We are last in the SEC in turning the ball over, and you saw why tonight. We obviously have to be a whole lot better at ball security and protecting the football because we didn’t do a great job of protecting to start the second half. Credit to our defense, we put them in some tough positions, and they kept playing. I just told the team in there, I am proud of the way they fought. It wasn’t always pretty, but the effort was good. There is no, ‘We are going to find out a lot about this team.’ I saw what kind of men we have in that room. Now, we obviously have to coach and play a lot better than we did tonight.”
