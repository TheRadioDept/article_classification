Every week we bring you all the inactives from the 1 p.m. ET games in one post, constantly updated with the latest information.

Four teams listed their starting quarterbacks as questionable to play in Week 10, but neither the Bills nor the Titans will have to call on their backups. Signs pointed to Josh Allen and Ryan Tannehill being active for Sunday’s games when their teams passed on promoting third quarterbacks from the practice squad and both players avoided the inactive list 90 minutes ahead of kickoff.

It remains to be seen if both quarterbacks will start, but it seems likely that they are going to play if the team feels they’re healthy enough to be in uniform.

Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray and Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford are the other questionable signal callers. Their fate will be known in a few hours, but reports on Sunday morning weren’t optimistic about their chances.
