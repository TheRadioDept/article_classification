There seems to be a good chance that the Denver Broncos will be looking for a new head coach in 2023. Which candidates make the most sense? I unfortunately do not think that the Broncos will end up digging themselves out of this hole that they are in.

I am low on Nathaniel Hackett and do believe he is getting fired at the end of the season. If they prove me wrong and end up turning the season around, then I’ll be super pleased. However, General Manager George Paton and his staff appear to be headed towards their third head coach in as many years.

They fired Vic Fangio after the 2021 season and hired the former Green Bay Packers’ offensive coordinator. So far, it’s been nothing short of a disaster, and I think the Broncos will have a new head man in 2022. Which candidates make the most sense?

Most logical 2023 head coaching candidates for the Broncos

Frank Reich

Frank Reich is a good head coach and I don’t think roster mismanagement by Indianapolis is his. Chris Ballard, their GM, has no idea what positional value is and doesn’t take calculated risks in free agency.

He neglected parts of the roster which should not be held against Reich. He went 40-33-1 as head coach of the Colts from 2018-2022, having a top ten scoring offense in three of those seasons. He also can build a good staff, as he had Jonathan Gannon, Matt Eberflus, and Nick Sirianni on his staff at once.

He’s also gotten solid production out of veteran quarterbacks, so his chances of succeeding with Russell Wilson seem to be good. Reich isn’t a young, flashy offensive mind, but he’s an adult and good at what he does.
