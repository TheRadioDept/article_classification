Max Verstappen was left to reflect on a “difficult” Sprint in Sao Paulo as the Red Bull driver took the chequered flag in P4 – while team mate Sergio Perez admitted his concern at the team’s pace when compared to Mercedes.

Verstappen started the Sprint in second – as one of two drivers along with Nicholas Latifi to start on the medium tyre, with the rest of the grid opting for softs. The Red Bull racer quickly got past Kevin Magnussen for the lead but was passed himself by George Russell on Lap 14 of 24.

Verstappen then came under pressure from Carlos Sainz, and as the Spaniard made his way past, the two racers collided, leaving the Dutch driver with front wing damage. Verstappen then lost another place to Lewis Hamilton, meaning he finished the Sprint in fourth.

“It was way more difficult than we expected it somehow,” said Verstappen when asked whether he found the Sprint hard on the medium tyre. “I didn’t expect to have that [tyre degradation]. Then even on the soft we wouldn’t have been fast enough, so we are clearly struggling on keeping the tyres alive.

“So, this is something we need to try and fix for tomorrow. Even though of course there is not a lot we can do but it can’t get worse than this… At the moment [Mercedes] look unbeatable, but we will analyse everything.”
