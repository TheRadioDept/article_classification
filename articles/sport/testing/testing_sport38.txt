A win in College Park came tougher than expected, but Ohio State improved to 11-0 nonetheless on Saturday.

After trailing at halftime, the Buckeyes battled back to beat the Terps 43-30 on the road behind a 33-point second half. Afterward, head coach Ryan Day met with media members to review the biggest moments from the victory, update the health status of several key players and look ahead to next week's all-important rivalry matchup with Michigan.

Following Day, freshman running back Dallan Hayden – who finished with 146 rushing yards and three scores – stepped up to take questions.

We took notes on everything Day and Hayden said at their postgame press conference below.

Ryan Day

On Dallan Hayden: “We didn’t quite get the running game going in the first half. We made the change to Dallan and he really got us into a rhythm.” Day says “he almost broke a couple.” Day says “this is big” for Hayden as a freshman.

Day says “the number one goal is to win and move on.” Day says “we’ve won big” at times this season, but the most important thing is to get a victory.

“We really buckled down in the third quarter, did a nice job there.”

On the passing defense, Day says “there are some plays in there that we’re gonna look at and try to address what’s going on there.” But Day credited Taulia Tagovailoa for a standout effort at quarterback.

Day says “it’s hard to say” whether the focus was there or not this week because of the Michigan game to come. Day says the first words he said to his team after the game were about the “team up north.”

Day says it “has not been easy” living with a loss to Michigan for the past year.

Day says the extra point when Ohio State went for two points was “a mistake that we can’t let happen.”

Day knows Michigan was "in a battle today," but says "that's winning games in the Big Ten in November."

On TreVeyon Henderson, Day says "we did hold Tre" out of the game due to injury late.

On Lathan Ransom's punt block: "I mean, production. ... This guy's producing. ... That's amazing."

Day says Matt Jones "got rolled up on" late in the game, but didn't get any other update on the starting guard immediately after the game.

Day says Henderson had "a great week of practice" and didn't experience much pain up until Saturday's game.

Day says the Buckeyes are "more experienced" and have been on a 12-game win streak since last year's game against Michigan. "Now all the chips go in."

Day says Michigan is going to "try to run right at us" next week.

Day says "the hope" is for Miyan Williams to return to the fold next week.

Dallan Hayden

Hayden says the coaching staff was telling him to calm down at one point in the game because it's easy for a freshman to be overwhelmed in that kind of environment.

Hayden says "I've never really been like a dancing kind of back" and says he's always been good at getting vertical on his runs.

Hayden tries to maintain a "next play mentality" but says "I can always get better" and "stronger" moving forward.

Hayden says playing so much in a game like that proves how much the coaching staff trusts him.

"Coming in, I honestly didn't know what to expect." Hayden says he learned the playbook quicky over the summer and it helped him a lot.

"I feel like I have the best running back coach in the country."

On getting 27 carries, Hayden says "I got a lot of carries in high school. ... I've had a workload in high school." But Hayden says it's "way different than high school."

Other Buckeyes that met with reporters after the game included C.J. Stroud, Zach Harrison and Lathan Ransom.
