PISCATAWAY, N.J. — Turning to depth because of injuries has been nothing new for the Penn State offense in the second half of this season, and Saturday's game against Rutgers was no different.

Penn State wide receiver Parker Washington, who leads the team in catches and receiving yards, didn’t make the trip to SHI Stadium for the Nittany Lions' 55-10 victory over the Scarlet Knights, and while coach James Franklin didn't have an update on Washington's status during his postgame news conference, Washington's absence provided more opportunities for other pass catchers to step into bigger roles.

"I mean, I feel like with him going down, I felt like me, being an older guy in the room, I had to bring the guys along," fifth-year senior Mitchell Tinsley said. "I felt like it's the next man up mentality, and I feel like everybody was ready to play today."

Franklin indicated he'll have more on what's ahead for Washington next week ahead of the season finale against Michigan State.

"I will have to wait until Tuesday to talk to you about Parker," Franklin said. "I want to make sure that I'm clear with what's going on, and I have not talked to Parker yet. I'd like to be able to do that first, then I'll make sure I answer your question."

Washington entered Saturday leading Penn State with 46 catches for 611 yards (13.28 yards per catch) and two touchdowns on the season, and he was just a couple weeks removed from a breakout performance against No. 2 Ohio State where he caught 11 passes for 179 yards and one touchdown.

Without Washington, Penn State moved Tinsley to the slot to start, while junior KeAndre Lambert-Smith and redshirt freshman Harrison Wallace III started on the outside. Tinsley led Penn State in receiving against Rutgers with five catches for 63 yards, while Wallace had three catches for 49 yards. Lambert-Smith was involved in the short passing game and finished with three catches for nine yards.

Redshirt freshman Liam Clifford also worked in the slot over the course of Saturday evening and caught one pass for 10 yards, while freshman Omari Evans had one catch for 11 yards.

Overall, quarterback Sean Clifford finished 17-of-26 passing (65.3%) for 157 yards and one touchdown on the night.

"Yeah, I thought that the receivers, they have a bunch of leadership in there," Clifford said postgame. "Mitch and Dre stepped up, Tre, throughout the whole week, so I think that for sure, a bummer, but at the same time, great leadership in the wide receiver room."

"I think pretty good," Franklin said when asked about the performance of the wide receivers. "Early on, we weren't in rhythm the way I thought we needed to be. But yeah, Parker, obviously not having him for this game, that's a big loss. As you guys know a good percentage of our passing game has gone through him, not just this year, but last year. He's a leader for us as well. So, I thought those other guys did a nice job. Obviously, we're gonna have to build on it, and we'll see how this plays out with Parker, but we're gonna have to build on it. Either way, their rep count is gonna go up."

Redshirt sophomore Malick Meiga and freshman Kaden Saunders were two more wide receivers who made the travel roster.

The absence of Washington just made wide receiver another position where Penn State had to adjust. Since August, Caziah Holmes entered the transfer portal, Devyn Ford left the program and Keyvone Lee got hurt at running back. Three-fifths of the starting offensive line from Week 1 — left tackle Olu Fashanu, left guard Landon Tengwall and right tackle Caedan Wallace — has missed significant time over the past month.

Penn State, though, has weathered it all, and it's gotten the Nittany Lions to the cusp of 10 wins with one more game remaining. And depending on what the outlook for Washington is, Penn State will be ready to adjust where necessary.

"Yeah, it's about the work in the offseason," Clifford said. "It's about understanding your role, I think, too. I think every guy in the locker room has really made it a serious point to make sure that, honestly, whatever happens, we're going to have depth. And that's a testament to the freshmen, that's a testament to the young guys coming in and setting the tone with us."
