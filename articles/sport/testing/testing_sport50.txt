Paul Finebaum has a love-hate relationship with Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin, and his upset pick for Saturday night could pour some fuel on the fire, too, if the Hogs wind up victorious.

During Saturday morning’s SEC Nation show, Finebaum predicted the Arkansas Razorbacks will beat the Ole Miss Rebels. Ole Miss is favored by 1.5 points against Arkansas.

“What I’m about to say is going to sound patently ridiculous, but I’m going to say it anyway,” Finebaum said. “This is a sandwich game, and what I mean by that is Ole Miss played Alabama last week. They play the Egg Bowl on Thursday night, and as much as they care about the rivalry, they’re going to lose tonight. Arkansas pulls the upset.”

Arkansas leads the series all-time series record 37-29-1, and the Hogs have the home crowd behind them Saturday.

Finebaum is counting on the Rebels reeling from the Alabama loss and looking ahead to the Egg Bowl on Thanksgiving night.

Will the Hogs pull the upset in Fayetteville Saturday? Arkansas and Ole Miss kickoff at 7:30 p.m. ET on the SEC Network.
