All you need to know ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar

Former Everton and Wigan manager Roberto Martinez, now in charge of Belgium is out of contract at the end of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar with his future uncertain

Roberto Martinez's Belgium future is in the balance going into the World Cup.

The former Everton and Wigan boss is out of contact at the end of the tournament and was expected to sign a new contract on the eve of the Red Devils’ departure to Qatar after five months of talks with the Royal Belgian FA.

Martinez, 49, was confident of sealing an agreement that would bank him £3million-a-year before his squad jetted out to Qatar. But promises made to him have not been kept - and his future is now clouded in doubt after six years in the job.

Martinez has been in charge of Belgium’s Golden Generation, with players like Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne and Vincent Kompany securing their nation a third-placed finish at the 2018 World Cup. But despite also taking them to the top of the FIFA rankings for four years, there is still a feeling amongst fans that Martinez has underachieved with the talent at his disposal.

It is now or never for the Spaniard - and the next month will decide his long-term future. Many of Belgium’s best players have passed the age of 30 and questions are being asked whether Martinez is the right coach to oversee a rebuild.

Belgium are taking a huge gamble. If Martinez masterminds a successful World Cup campaign then he will be offered a new contract. But that would also alert clubs to his availability - and Martinez has designs on returning to the Premier League.

Martinez is resolved to keeping contract talk off the table until after the tournament. But his agent and lawyer, Jesse De Preter, has admitted that the Spaniard feels let down.

De Preter said: “Belgium keep pretending they want to continue to work with Martinez, but where is the contract?

“They have told the media that we have been having talks. That is correct. We have had talks several times. But nothing is happening.

“No contract has been offered so far - and they promised it would be before the team flew to Qatar. People now think it is Martinez who wants too much money. But he has never been bothered about more money. For six years he has not cared about his salary, it has never been an issue.

.There is a whole negative atmosphere around Roberto now. And the players are wondering what is going on too. It does not feel right.”
