EUGENE, Ore. — With its fourth Pac-12 championship game in five seasons in sight, No. 10 Utah let the moment get to them against No. 12 Oregon.

It wasn't the hostile environment of Autzen Stadium or the cold temperatures that started at 31 degrees at kickoff and dropped as the game progressed. It was Utah's inability for much of the game to get a push at the line of scrimmage and get points in the red zone.

Utah had three red zone trips in the first half that resulted in 3 total points — a missed field goal and a turnover on downs negated two drives — and the Utes found themselves in trouble.

The Utes battled back after a slow start, thanks to a scoop-and-score touchdown by linebacker Karene Reid and an 18-yard rushing touchdown by Jaylen Dixon, to tie up the game 17-all before the Ducks held on for a 20-17 win in the late-night battle.

Oregon won the game on a 41-yard field goal with 11:17 left in the game after Dixon had tied the game at 17-17 late in the third quarter and ended the game with three consecutive stops on defense.

Utah had a chance to take the lead, but quarterback Cam Rising threw the ball at tight end Dalton Kincaid's feet on a pivotal fourth-and-2 deep in Oregon territory that would have been a first down had Kincaid had a chance to catch it.

Clark Phillips III picked off Oregon quarterback Bo Nix with 5:30 left in the fourth, jumping a pass on the left side intended with 5:50 left for his sixth interception of the year to give the Utes a chance. But Rising threw into coverage over the middle four plays later, and Bennett Williams was more than happy to oblige with an interception that helped seal the Ducks' win.

"He's huge, and he was one of the guys in the training room today," Nix told ESPN of Williams after the game. "It's just legitimately toughness; that's all it comes down to. We were tough, we played tough, we played as a team and we played with uncommon purpose.

"I wouldn't trade this team for the world."

Rising threw for 170 yards and three picks, and ran for 43 yards. Tavion Thomas added 55 yards on the ground.

Oregon quarterback Bo Nix, who was questionable leading up to the game, finished the night with 287 passing yards and a touchdown and an interception.

Limited by an injury that kept him from scrambling, Nix's first forward-progress run of the night converted a crucial fourth-and-one in the final minutes to seal the victory.
