Football’s biggest tournament is back, 1,589 days after France beat Croatia to win Russia 2018, the 2022 World Cup kicks off later today as host nation Qatar face Ecuador.

As we count down to these last few hours to the first game of the finals, we want to hear from you about which World Cup opening game of the past is your favourite.

For some, it will be Argentina and Cameroon in 1990, where the reigning champions were shocked in more ways than one, thanks to some wince-inducing tackling. Or what about 2002, when Senegal, who were making their World Cup debut, also defeated the holders, France.

Scotland fans were dreaming when they equalised against Brazil in Paris in 1998, but they couldn’t push on for a famous victory, while it’s arguable the high-point of the 1994 version came before Germany and Bolivia even kicked off as pop star Diana Ross missed THAT staged penalty during the opening ceremony that preceded the match.
