Kansas quarterback Jalon Daniels, one of the breakout stars of the 2022 college football season, returned to the lineup Saturday, but the Jayhawks suffered a 55-14 loss to Texas.

Daniels had not played since injuring his shoulder in an Oct. 8 loss to TCU, Kansas' first loss of the season.

By then, Daniels had emerged as one of the faces of the 2022 season. He started out the season scorching, throwing for 11 touchdowns, 1,072 yards and just one interception. He also rushed for 335 yards and five touchdowns.

Daniels had been considered in the thicket of the Heisman Trophy race before his injury, as he had elevated Kansas to a No. 19 ranking. The Jayhawks hadn't been ranked since 2009.

He threw for 230 yards with two touchdowns and one interception in Saturday's loss. Including the game Daniels left with injury against TCU, Kansas has lost five of six.

Daniels' primary backup, Jason Bean, has been solid for the Jayhawks but also has been dealing with an injury, missing a handful for plays at the end of Kansas' loss to Texas Tech last week after a hard hit. Kansas coach Lance Leipold told reporters this week that Bean didn't do much in practice early this week after suffering an upper-body injury.

Bean also played Saturday, going 1-for-3 for 12 yards.

The game against Texas in Lawrence serves as a coda for Kansas' sudden burst from the depths of Power 5 football. Last year, Kansas stunned the Longhorns in Austin 57-56 in overtime. Kansas was a 31-point underdog, and the victory marked the program's first Big 12 road win since 2008.

Since then, Kansas proved that wasn't a fluke moment. The Jayhawks started this season 5-0 and have since clinched the program's first bowl game since 2008 with a blowout win over Oklahoma State.
