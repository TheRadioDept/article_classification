The USMNT is back in the World Cup for the first time since 2014 after failing to qualify for the 2018 tournament. The World Cup is being held in the Middle East, for the first time ever with the small nation of Qatar hosting all of the games.

In the 2022 World Cup, the USMNT is in Group B, which includes Wales, Iran and England, a team they faced in the 2010 tournament.

This year’s games will be played in November for the first time ever. The games are typically played over the summer, during the European leagues’ offseasons, but because of Qatar’s climate during the summer months in which temperatures can get up to 104 degrees and usually don’t go under 85, it was moved to November and December. Temperatures in the winter months in Qatar average from the mid-70s to mid-80s.

Here’s what you need to know about how to watch the USMNT in the 2022 World Cup.
