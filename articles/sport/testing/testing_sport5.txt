Fantasy football is more than just the weekly head-to-head games we’ve all grown to love. On Underdog, fantasy managers can put their player-projection skills to the test by predicting player stat lines. Here are my top plays for Underdog’s Week 11 Pick’em contest.

Top Underdog Pick ’ems for Week 11 Sunday Games

Underdog Pick’ems allow fantasy managers to predict stat lines and fantasy-point totals for almost all fantasy-relevant players. You can make two picks that pay out 3x even money or add more selections to your entry for higher payouts.

The levels are 3x, 6x, 10x, and 20x, progressing with each additional pick’em you add to your entry. Let’s take a look at this week’s NFL pick’ems.

DJ Moore Lower Than 54.5 Receiving Yards

This one has nothing to do with the opponent. Baker Mayfield is back under center for the Panthers. DJ Moore averages 64.2 yards per game with PJ Walker and 36.8 with Baker Mayfield.

Moore has exceeded 50 receiving yards exactly three times all season. None of those instances came with Mayfield. This projection does not accurately reflect the impact Mayfield has. The only way I see this losing is if Mayfield gets benched for Sam Darnold at halftime. And even then, it’s far from a certainty.

Davis Mills Lower Than 220.5 Passing Yards

We took a tough loss on Davis Mills’ passing yards lower last week, but that’s not going to scare me off taking it again this week. The Texans were faced with negative game script against the Giants. Thus, they went extremely pass-heavy.

Mills does have two 300-yard passing games in his last five. However, in the other three, he’s thrown for between 140 and 154 yards. That’s more of what I’m expecting this week.

The Commanders allow 212.7 passing yards per game. More importantly, I expect the Texans to win this game. That means mostly neutral game script, which should keep the ball in Dameon Pierce’s hands, and Mills throwing far less than he did last week.

Allen Robinson II Lower Than 50.5 Receiving Yards

This is the highest we’ve seen Allen Robinson II’s receiving yards projection since Week 1. We can attribute that to Cooper Kupp’s high ankle sprain, which presumptively elevates Robinson to the WR1 role.

I’m just not a believer in Robinson’s usage changing. He caught four of six targets for 44 yards last week. Robinson has three games over 50 receiving yards on the season. I think Tyler Higbee and Ben Skowronek benefit far more than Robinson.

Andy Dalton Lower Than 30.5 Pass Attempts and Lower Than 212.5 Passing Yards

We’ve now seen Andy Dalton start seven games this season. In three of those, he surpassed this projection. Two of those games shootouts with over 50 points. The Saints and Rams are projected for fewer than 40 points this week.

Dalton hasn’t attempted more than 30 passes in three straight games. He threw for 174 and 210 yards in his last two. The Rams allow 211 passing yards per game.

The Rams average 30.6 seconds between snaps, the third-slowest rate in the league. The Saints average 28.8 seconds between snaps, which is middle of the pack. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Rams play even slower without Cooper Kupp.

Furthermore, I’m not so sure we don’t see Jameis Winston replace Andy Dalton if the latter struggles this week. Dalton is 2-5 as a starter. The Saints have lost two straight and four of their last five, and Dalton has thrown six interceptions in his last four games.

To be candid, I’m surprised the Saints haven’t gone back to Winston already. If it happens this week, Dalton obviously won’t get anywhere near either of these numbers.

Melvin Gordon III Higher Than 9.5 Receiving Yards

This number just looks far too low. Am I missing something? I sure hope not.

Melvin Gordon III has nine receptions over his last three games. He’s posted receiving yardage totals of 46, 23, and 17.

Gordon has had more than 10 receiving yards in every game where he’s seen a snap share of at least 38%. If we remove the two games where he was basically benched, he’s only gone lower than this number once.

23.75% of targets and 19.9% of the Raiders’ receiving yards against go to running backs. Gordon is the primary receiving back ahead of Latavius Murray and newly acquired Chase Edmonds, so he should be able to top this projection.

Kirk Cousins Higher Than 0.5 Interceptions

My typical attitude towards the Cowboys is to be overly pessimistic. They always let me down. This week is probably the most confident I’ve ever been that they will win a game.

Last week, the Cowboys lost because the defense fell apart in the fourth quarter, blowing a two-touchdown lead. They are as motivated as ever to put forth a strong effort, and I believe that will result in Kirk Cousins being forced into multiple mistakes.

Cousins has thrown three interceptions in his last two games. He’s thrown at least one pick in four of his last six. The Cowboys haven’t recorded an interception in two straight games for the first time all season. I don’t think they extend that streak to three.

Joe Burrow Higher Than 254.5 Passing Yards

Two weeks ago, I was on Joe Burrow’s passing yards higher. Instead, Joe Mixon scored five touchdowns, and the Bengals really didn’t have to throw. Burrow attempted just 28 passes and threw for 206 yards.

This week, Burrow gets a Steelers defense allowing the third-most passing yards per game. This is also a revenge spot, as the Bengals lost back in Week 1 at home to the Steelers.

The Bengals lead the NFL in neutral game script pass rate at 69%. Look for them to come out throwing early and often. Burrow may get 75% of the way there by halftime.

My Underdog Entry

While I believe in all of these picks and would play them all straight if I could, here is my entry with my most confident picks.
