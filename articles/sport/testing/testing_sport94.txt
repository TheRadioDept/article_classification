Talk about a weird week to make predictions about the Oregon Ducks, right?

If things weren’t already heightened enough with the Ducks coming off of a loss and looking for some vengeance based on the way that the 2021 season ended at the hands of the Utes, then once you throw the Bo Nix health situation into it all, it gets downright crazy.

When you don’t know if the starting quarterback, and arguably the best player on the field, is going to play or not, it gets pretty tough to predict the outcome. At Ducks Wire, we tried our best to still touch on what type of game we are going to see play out, and how the Ducks may fare.

To help preview all of the action, Ducks Wire writers Zachary Neel, Don Smalley, and Andy Patton gathered to make predictions and offer opinions on what we might see.

Here is your eleventh Ducks Wire Roundtable of the 2022 season. Enjoy.
