Texas' 55-14 rout of Kanas on a frigid Saturday afternoon in Lawrence probably cemented junior running back Bijan Robinson's status as one of the most underutilized superstars in Longhorns' history.

One week after getting only 12 carries (the fewest since his freshman season) in a 17-10 loss to No. 4 TCU, all Robinson did was take over the game with one Heisman-worthy highlight reel run after another while rushing for a career-high 243 yards on 25 carries (9.7 yards per carry) and four touchdowns in keeping the Longhorns' flickering hopes of back-dooring their way into the Big 12 title game alive. Texas (7-4, 5-3 Big 12) would need to beat Baylor next Friday and hope Kansas can knock off Kansas State (8-3, 6-2), which won 48-31 at West Virginia on Saturday.

One can only wonder if the Texas offense could’ve gotten into a rhythm running the ball against TCU the way Baylor did Saturday - would Texas have won that game and would Bijan Robinson be in the Heisman Trophy discussion?

One week after Robinson had 12 carries for 29 yards in that home loss to TCU, Baylor ran the ball 46 times for 232 yards (5 ypc) and three touchdowns in a 29-27 last-second loss to TCU in Waco.

After a failed first drive in which Texas coach Steve Sarkisian got away from running the ball and went five-and-out, Robinson took over the game with nine runs of 10 yards or more, including touchdown runs of 17 and 32 yards, and may have at least moved into serious consideration for the Doak Walker Award - along with Illinois’ Chase Brown, Michigan’s Blake Corum, Ole Miss’ Quinshon Judkins and TCU’s Kendre Miller.

With his 243 yards rushing, Robinson moved from seventh into a tie for No. 5 on UT's all-time rushing list with Chris Gilbert at 3,231 yards - passing Vince Young (3,127 yards) and now trailing only Ricky Williams (6,279), Cedric Benson (5,540), Earl Campbell (4,443) and Jamaal Charles (3,328).

Robinson’s day was done before the end of the third quarter but not before making one jaw-dropping run after another, including zig-zagging, tackle-breaking runs of 21, 31 and 24 yards. On the 24-yarder, Robinson started right, cut back left, broke three tackles and got pushed out of bounds at the KU 1 with :01 left on the clock. On the next play, Robinson went old-school Walter Payton, diving high over the pile and practically somersaulting into the end zone for his third touchdown of the game and a 31-0 lead at intermission.
