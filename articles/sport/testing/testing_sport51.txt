Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin contemplates from the sideline Saturday night in Fayetteville.

There just isn't that much to say. An ill-prepared Ole Miss team got its butt whipped Saturday night in Fayetteville. The Hogs, at one point, were beating Ole Miss 42-6 early in the third quarter. At that point, the game was over. Hell, who am I kidding? It was over at the half when the scoreboard read 35-6.

Anything the Rebels scored after that were simply junk points. The final ended up being 42-27.

The question is why. Why...and how...did this happen? What caused this?

I'm writing this before Lane Kiffin's postgame press conference, and I'm sure he will give us his take. Though I don't know if he'll say it or not, I imagine it has something to do with the circus that has been in town the last three weeks known as Auburn. Is he going, or is he not? I don't know, but something was amiss Saturday night. And Kiffin has not answered the question.

We all saw what happened.

Maybe Arkansas was just that much better. I didn't think so, but the final score suggests otherwise.

Maybe the Rebels were distracted...by something. That will never be admitted, so you can judge that for yourselves.

Maybe they were just cold and play better in warmer climates.

I digress.

Quinshon Judkins played his tail off, as he ran for 214 yards and a touchdown and in the process broke Kayo Dottley's Ole Miss single-season rushing record. In fact, the Ole Miss offense accumulated yardage, 703 total yards, and still lost.

Badly.

I don't know what to make of any of it. Not yet, anyway.

Ole Miss has to turn around and host Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl on Thanksgiving night. That's four days from now.

They had best start getting ready. They weren't tonight.
