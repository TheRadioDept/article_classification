Lane Kiffin is aware his name has been heavily associated with Auburn’s head coaching vacancy this fall.

Kiffin’s name has been linked to Auburn since before the Tigers fired Bryan Harsin on Halloween, and the buzz has only picked up in the almost three weeks since new Auburn athletics director John Cohen began his search for the program’s next coach. Kiffin has been the candidate most associated with the job on the Plains, and multiple reports have suggested he’s the Tigers’ No. 1 target.

Kiffin was asked about those reports again Saturday night after Ole Miss’ double-digit loss to Arkansas, as well as a report earlier this week that said the Rebels offered him a new contract and raise to remain in Oxford, Miss.

“Fair question,” Kiffin said when asked about being viewed as Auburn’s top target. “Like I said, I love being here. I don’t want to look to next year already with a regular-season game (still to play), but this is not one of those years where you were, ‘We’re going to lose all these guys.’ There’s a lot of people coming back, and a lot of new guys offensively, especially. So, very excited about the future. So, I don’t know all that stuff out there — No. 1 (candidate) stuff. Maybe if they watched the first half (against Arkansas), I wouldn’t be No. 1 anymore.”

Ole Miss lost to Arkansas, 42-27, in Fayetteville, Ark., on Saturday night. The Rebels trailed 35-6 at halftime while turning the ball over twice, punting twice and missing a field goal.

It was Ole Miss’ second straight loss after opening the season 8-0, having lost to Alabama a week earlier.

Despite that loss to the Tide, a report surfaced earlier this week about Ole Miss extending a new contract to Kiffin that would have made him one of the 10 highest-paid coaches in the country. Kiffin, who currently makes $7.25 million a year and is the 11th-highest paid coach in college football this season, declined to address that report head-on, noting he “never” discusses such things, and while he expressed appreciation for the administration at Ole Miss, he didn’t exactly put to bed any talk of a potential exit from Ole Miss after the Rebels wrap up their regular-season slate with the Egg Bowl against rival Mississippi State on Thanksgiving Day.

“I’m very happy here,” Kiffin said. “I mean, I’m not happy right now, but that has nothing to do with being here. I’m not happy with the outcome (against Arkansas) because I wanted to get to 9-2 and get to 10-2 next week, so that’s all I’m worried about. So, I’m very happy to be here. I’m very appreciative of leadership here and the stuff they do to give us a chance to win.”
