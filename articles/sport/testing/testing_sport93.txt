We were live from Autzen Stadium for No. 12 Oregon’s narrow 20-17 victory over the No. 10 Utah Utes on Saturday night in Eugene.

Bo Nix battled through a sore ankle to complete 25 of 37 passes for 287 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Normally a dual threat, Nix finished the game with just one positive rush, but it was an important one as his third-down dive for 2 yards with less than two minutes to play iced the game for the Ducks.

Oregon (9-2, 7-1 Pac-12) opened as a three-point favorite, Utah (8-3, 6-2 Pac-12) was favored by as much as 2.5, but the line then flipped back to UO minus-1, according to VegasInsider.com. The line flipped due to the uncertainty of Nix’s status.

Here’s a recap of how the game unfolded:

FINAL: OREGON 20, UTAH 17

-- Whittington runs for 1 yard, then 8 yards. He slides just short of the first down. Utah calls timeout with 1:44 left. Now Bo Nix keeps it and dives ahead for two yards, just enough for the first down. That’s his first positive run of the night. And it clinches the 20-17 win for Oregon. Nix kneels it down twice, and the Ducks beat Utah.

-- Utah starts from its 24. A 9-yard completion to Vele and a 13-yard Rising keeper move the Utes to their 46-yard line. But then the drive stalls. On fourth and 6, Rising’s pass is dropped and the Ducks take over on downs.
