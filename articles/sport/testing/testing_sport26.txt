South Carolina managed one of the top wins in program history Saturday night against fifth-ranked Tennessee, upsetting the Volunteers as a 23-point underdog for a 63-38 victory. With it, Tennessee suffered its second loss of the season, likely ending the Vols' hopes of reaching the College Football Playoff. It was the most points the Gamecocks have ever scored against a top-5 opponent. Spencer Rattler, the transfer quarterback from Oklahoma, delivered a marquee performance with a six-touchdown outburst.

"This is a great night for Rattler, Marcus Satterfield and company," ESPN's Kirk Herbstreit said in the fourth quarter. "Shane Beamer is trying to build a program here and wins like this, you can already picture the post-game interviews. This is a landmark win from a recruiting standpoint. He's trying to create some momentum here and a win like this justifies the vision. It's not just you knock off No. 5 Tennessee, it's really helping yourself get to what you're trying to do here."

Rattler threw for 438 yards, a season-high for the Gamecocks, who scored 35 points in the first half and 21 in the final quarter.
