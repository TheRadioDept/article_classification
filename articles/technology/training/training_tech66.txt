Sony's Extra Bass technology provides impressively deep, punchy sound in these over-ear headphones. Charge in minutes, listen all day and create the soundscape you want — Dual Noise Cancelling lets you truly shut out everything around you and enjoy your party for one.

"I bought these to wear at work when I need to focus. I'm in a cube, and it's hard to concentrate when I can hear everything going on around me," shared one reviewer. "When I turn the noise-cancelling feature on I can't hear any of it; the difference is really amazing. The ambient sound setting is nice, too, if I want to be able to hear anyone but not have to take the headphones off."
