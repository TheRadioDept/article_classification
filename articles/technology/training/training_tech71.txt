Gulag in COD Warzone 2.0: What’s New?

Players are excited about all the changes lined up in COD Warzone 2 including a new mechanic for custom loadouts and a revamped Gulag system. Notably, players are sent to the Gulag when they are killed on the battlefield in Warzone. In the prequel, players had to fight another player in a 1v1 duel to see who gets to return to the field. Meanwhile, the one that loses the 1v1 is eliminated from play instantaneously.

Here’s where Warzone 2.0 switches things up. Instead of a 1v1 combat, players will be taking on a 2v2 duel. Additionally, the game is also bringing in an AI character, called the Jailer, who can also be killed.

This newly revamped Gulag system in COD Warzone 2 will drop the four players, randomly paired duos, in a 2v2 environment. They must work together in pairs and take down the other team. Notably, all players will get access to a predefined loadout and it could be a pistol or a shotgun, a lethal grenade, and a tactical grenade. But there will also be better weapons scattered around as ground loot in the center of the map. Players will be able to take any of these weapons along with them if they manage to escape the Gulag.

The COD Warzone 2.0 Gulag experience includes the Jailer, who appears in the middle of the timed deathmatch to hasten the combat. Teams can now wait for the Jailer to spawn and eliminate him together, which will return all four players to the match, or try and go for the 2v2 duel, and eliminate the opposing team for victory. In order to communicate with your opponents, you will have to use the newly-added proximity chat feature.

Note that if neither team nor the Jailer is eliminated, after a brief period of time, all four players will be eliminated.
