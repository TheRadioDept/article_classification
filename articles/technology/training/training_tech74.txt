Call of Duty Warzone 2.0 and Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 will have a massive combined file size of almost 200 GB.

The brand new battle royale mode for Call of Duty, Warzone 2.0, is all set to arrive on November 16, 2022, following the release of Modern Warfare 2. It has been reported that Warzone 2.0 will have an install size of 115 GB, bringing the combined file size with Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 to almost 200 GB. Fans are therefore cautioned to clear some space on their console and PC storage in order to download and install the new mode.

Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 currently weighs in at 78.04 GB on PS5 with the current version 1.08 (1.008.000) update installed. With the arrival of Call of Duty Warzone 2.0, the total file size is expected to be in the ballpark of 194 GB. Warzone fans were previously unhappy with the file size of the original battle royale game. Given the revealed size for Warzone 2.0, it doesn’t look like things will be any different with the latest version, even on current-gen consoles. Chances are the file size will get significantly larger in the months and years to come, as more content is added to the game.

Previously, it was revealed that a paid expansion for Call of duty Modern Warfare 2 will launch sometime in the year 2023, and it is expected to be equivalent to a “full premium release”. In its 3rd Quarter 2022 press release, Activision announced that it is looking forward to building on its current momentum in 2023, with plans for next year including a new full premium release in the blockbuster annual series.

Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier shared his thoughts on the official statement from Activision, stating that the next Call of Duty game, developed by Treyarch, is set for release in the year 2024. According to him, there will be a “premium” (paid) expansion for Modern Warfare 2 in 2023, and it will be developed by Sledgehammer. He added that the expansion is set to offer lots of new content, which is likely why Activision is treating it as a “full” release.
