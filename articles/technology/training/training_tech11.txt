Amazon's Black Friday deals are heating up, with discounts to be had on TVs, laptops, fitness equipment, home gear and more. In fact, there's almost too much to keep track of.

So I've narrowed down the top 17 deals that have caught my eye. High on the list of new sales is Amazon's new 65-inch Omni QLED 4K Fire TV, which only came out last month but has been sliced to $599; that's a good price for the first QLED TV in Amazon's Omni Fire TV lineup.

Other attention-grabbing discounts that have my attention include the a big sale on Bowflex adjustable dumbbells and up top 50% off select Anova Sous Vide precision cookers. Amazon has been offering good preview deals so far, but in my opinion they've yet to offer that killer deal that no other retailer matches. That said, the latest batch of deals is definitely ramping things up.

One thing worth noting is that Amazon is relying on third-party merchants a lot when it runs out of stock on select devices. That's not a major issue, but in a few instances we've seen third-party merchants offering used/renewed items instead of new items. While the product page usually displays when an item is used, the print can be small, so be alert of your merchant when hitting that buy button.

Below you'll find the best Amazon Black Friday deals I've seen today.
