Blizzard plans to change the reward system in Overwatch 2, so fans get free collectibles just for sitting down and playing.

In Overwatch 2, players don't get skins for free as often as they used to. Since the game doesn't have loot boxes anymore but now offers a whole battle pass system, basically everything in Overwatch 2 is hidden behind a paywall. Clearly, the game is free to play now, but $20 just for a new skin seems a bit excessive... To make playing the game feel more rewarding, Blizzard plans to add exciting challenges and more ways to get skins for free.

Overwatch 2 Changes Reward Structure – Get Free Skins



With the latest retail update, Blizzard's new executive producer for Overwatch 2, Jared Neuss, has published a blog post about things they want to improve in the future. One of those things is rewards and progression.



One of the biggest issues that I have with the free-to-play mechanic in Overwatch 2, is that I barely get rewarded for my playtime anymore. At least not if I don't buy the premium battle pass for $10, or the Watchpoint pack for $40... Do you see where I'm going with this? Fans, that don't spend money on the game, get nothing for playing it.



If winning or losing a match is totally irrelevant because you don't get rewarded anyway... They why should you even bother? A lot of players have lost interest in Overwatch 2 really fast because they don't get that kind of excitement anymore, that they had in the original game, when opening a loot box, or completing an event challenge.





Luckily, Blizzard has admitted, that Overwatch's reward structure, needs a bit of improvement. Now they are working on a better challenge system and free event skins that you can earn just by playing the game. There will be some new features in Season 2 this year and even bigger changes are planned for season 3 and the time after.
