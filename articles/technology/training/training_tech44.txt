Both the devices come with the new second-generation Tensor chipset and also feature smart software features, much like their predecessors. Right now, the Pixel 7 series would be your best bet to get an affordable Google-made smartphone as your primary device, but if you don’t want to spend as much as $600 on a new model, there’s a cheaper Google phone in the market right now – the Pixel 6a.

Google Pixel 7 vs Google Pixel 6a – Comparison

DESIGN

It’s easy to tell that the Pixel 6a comes from the same family as the Pixel 7 series. Both the phones feature a horizontal camera bar that extends to the two sides. They have round corners, a centered punch hole camera on the front and fresh color options too.

However, the Pixel 7 comes with a glass back, while the Pixel 6a features a plastic one. Also, the camera bar on the new Pixel 7 features a brushed aluminum finish, unlike the glass one on the 6a model.

In terms of dimensions too, the Pixel 7 is longer and wider than the Pixel 6a (155.6 x 73.2 x 8.7 mm vs 152.2 x 71.8 x 8.9 mm). The new model is also heavier at 197 grams vs 178 grams on the 6a. So there’s no doubt that the Pixel 6a is more compact and portable than the latest Pixel 7 series.

Another difference is that the Pixel 7 is IP68 certified while the 6a is only IP67 certified. In terms of colors, the new Pixel model comes in Onsidian, Lemongrass, and Snow options while the 6a came in Chalk, Charcoal, and Sage color options.

Overall, the new Pixel 7 has a slight advantage when it comes to the design as it looks and feels more premium than the older model. But the 6a is compact and lighter, making it good for one handed use.

End of the day, design will always be a personal preference, and this is applicable for these two models as well.

DISPLAY

The two models also differ in terms of its displays. Being the latest and a more expensive device from Google, the Pixel 7 comes with a slightly larger 6.3-inch AMOLED display with 90Hz refresh rate and 1400 nits brightness along with Corning gorilla glass victus protection. In comparison, the Pixel 6a features a smaller 6.1-inch OLED screen which is only HDR certified. As you might have figured, the older model doesn’t even feature a high refresh rate screen, putting it at a disadvantage.

SPECS

Being an older model, the Pixel 6a features the first generation Google Tensor chipset clocked at 2.80GHz with Mali-G78 MP20 GPU. On the other hand, the Pixel 7 features the latest second generation Google Tensor G2 clocked at 2.85GHz with Mali-G710 MP7 GPU. The new Tensor chip is faster and smarter than the first generation model enabling more smart features on the device.

In terms of the configuration, the Pixel 7 is available up to 256GB with 8GB of RAM while the Pixel 6a is only available in a 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM variant.

CONNECTIVITY

Connectivity wise, there aren’t many differences. Both the phones have Wi-Fi 6e, Bluetooth 5.2, and NFC. But the Pixel 7 features a tri-band Wi-Fi as opposed to 6a’s dual-band and the USB-C version also gets upgraded to 3.2 vs 2.1.

CAMERAS

On paper, the Pixel 7 might not seem like a significant upgrade over the Pixel 6a. The 7 comes with a 50MP f/1.9 aperture primary camera with OIS, and another 12MP ultra wide sensor on board. On the other hand, the Pixel 6a features a 12.2MP f/1.7 sensor and another 12MP ultrawide sensor (similar to the Pixel 7).

However, there are upgrades in terms of the camera features and processing, giving the Pixel 7 an edge over its older model. The new Pixel can also shooter 10-bit HDR videos.

On the front, the Pixel 7 gets a 10.8MP wide selfie camera as opposed to the 8MP sensor found on the Pixel 6a.

BATTERY & CHARGING

Battery capacity and charging are similar on the two models. The Pixel 7 comes with a 4355mAh battery with 20W wired charging while the Pixel 6a features a 4410mAh battery with 18W wired charging. However, the real differentiator is the added support for 20W wireless and reverse wireless charging on the Pixel 7.

PRICE

The Pixel 7 starts at an equivalent of $599 worldwide. On the other hand, the Pixel 6 started at the same $599 in the US last year but is available at discounted rates across the world.

VERDICT

Overall, the Pixel 7 is clearly a solid upgrade in terms of its camera, battery (wireless charging), and processing power. That said, if you don’t mind the lack of wireless charging and features like faster night sight or good quality blur-free photos, the Pixel for around $300-400 also makes for a good buy in 2022.
