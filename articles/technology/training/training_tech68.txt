God of War Ragnarok update 2.001 was pushed out on Saturday, but there were no patch notes accompanying it. I noticed the update yesterday morning when I first booted up the game on my PS5, but at the time of this writing, it’s still unclear what it does. Unfortunately, however, it doesn’t appear to fix the known difficulty bug that a number of people have been complaining about.

God of War Ragnarok update 2.001 is apparently only available on PS5

Perusing this Reddit thread, it appears that the update is only for PS5 consoles. Weighing just over 200 MB, the update had players hoping that Santa Monica Studio fixed the issue that prevents players from changing difficulty mid game, but that’s not the case. Since launch, players have been reporting that despite confirming change in difficulty during gameplay, the change does not take effect, leaving players to figure out different workarounds with little to no success.

The update was speculated to have modified the opening screen options menu’s position, but some Redditors have downplayed that suggestion, noting that the position of the menu changes after players first use a save file. That has been in place since release day.

We’ll keep our eyes peeled for patch notes and update our readers.
