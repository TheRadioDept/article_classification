Santa Monica Studio has released God of War Ragnarok update 2.001, and this title update seems to be just for the current-gen version of the game, as the PS4 version seems to still be at version 2.0. Given how the game just came out, this patch is primarily for bug fixes. Read on for what’s new in the God of War Ragnarok November 12 patch notes (November 13 for those outside the US).

Santa Monica Studio has not acknowledged the patch just yet, though we’re hoping that changes soon. That said, there are some audio issues in the game that we’re hoping gets sorted, though they aren’t as prevalent that a lot of people get it. One such issue is mentioned here.
