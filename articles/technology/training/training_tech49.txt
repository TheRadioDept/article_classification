Splatoon 3 is teaming up with PokÃ©mon Scarlet and Violet for a new Splatfest crossover. The latest Splatfest stars the three new starter PokÃ©mon that players can pick in Scarlet and Violet. As part of the Splatfest promotion, Nintendo is offering a service to customize your official Twitter profile. If you register your Twitter icon on the Nintendo website and connect with your Nintendo Account, an exclusive frame will appear on your profile image on Twitter as soon as the Splatfest begins.

When you register your Twitter account, you need to select a supporting team. In the PokÃ©mon Splatfest for Splatoon 3, players can support one of three teams during the event â€” Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. When you select a supporting team to link with your Twitter account, your profile image will match the color of the team you are supporting. Your Twitter icon will be green if you support Sprigatito, red if you support Fuecoco, and blue if you support Quaxly.

Your profile frame will change during Splatfestâ€™s interim report, with different color ink splattering across your Twitter profile image. The changes to your Twitter profile picture depend on your teamâ€™s situation during the Splatfest. If your team is doing well, you will have less ink on your icon.

Your Splatfest frame should go away at 9 AM on November 14. If you want to change your icon after registering, you will need to cancel your registration and re-register after changing your icon.

Nintendo is aggressively promoting Splatoon x Scarlet and Violet Splatfest. Apart from the Twitter Splafest frame service, Nintendo is also offering exclusive Splatoon keychains with Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. Players can purchase these keychains on Nintendoâ€™s official store, but they can only buy them if they have a My Nintendo account and can only use My Nintendo points. The keychains have since sold out.
