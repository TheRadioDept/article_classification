Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s post launch development and content cycle is coming to an end, Ubisoft has announced. On December 6th, update 1.6.2 will be released for the game and it will be the last update for Eivor’s journey. This update for Assassin’s Creed Valhalla will add the previously announced epilogue called The Last Chapter, which will wrap up some of the storylines in the game.

When update 1.6.2 is released you will have to have met some requirements to get access to The Last Chapter. Those requirements are as follows.

Complete the main storyline by pledging to all territories of England

Complete the mythical story arcs of Asgard and Jotunheim

Upgrade your settlement to level 5 and construct the Jomsviking barracks

Kill all targets of the Order of the Ancients and unveil its leader

If you are hoping for Assassin’s Creed Valhalla 1.6.2 to add a New Game Plus mode, then you will be disappointed. Ubisoft has ruled out the addition of the mode. The reason given for this is that due to the depth of the base game the development team have decided that there is not much more that could be added to make New Game Plus a worthwhile experience. This is because it just would not offer a rewarding experience.

Ubisoft also confirmed that the seasonal events in Ravensthorpe will no longer be running due to production wrapping up. All the rewards from all the past seasonal events, these being the Yule, Ostara, Sigrblot, and Oskoreia Festivals, will be available at merchants throughout England. However, to get access to these items the quest The First Night of Samhain needs to be completed first.

Assassin’s Creed Valhalla 1.6.2 will add a different feature that has been requested though, and that is to allow Eivor to keep their hood up at all times. The final update will add a few more things as well, but Ubisoft is keeping those under wraps until the final update is released.
