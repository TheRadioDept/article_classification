Gran Turismo series creator Kazunori Yamauchi has confirmed via Twitter that a new update is coming for Gran Turismo 7 this week, curiously referring to it as a “25th Anniversary Update”.

The confirmation takes its usual form of a teaser showing off some of the new content coming to the game in heavily disguised lighting conditions — the now-famous “silhouette” image.

As we’ve seen across GT7’s life, with one exception, the image contains three vehicles but no clues to any other content. The approximate date of the week commencing November 21 is also confirmed:

25周年記念アップデート、今週来ます。

A 25th anniversary update will be coming this week.#GT7 pic.twitter.com/TiNTDepQ12 — 山内 一典 (@Kaz_Yamauchi) November 20, 2022

The three cars in the image appear to be relatively easy to identify this time round. Up in the top-left corner we have the new-to-series — and highly requested — Ford Sierra RS Cosworth, given away by the enormous “whaletail” spoiler. It’s not clear if it’s the “base” model or the enhanced RS500 from the angle in the image.

At the bottom is a Nissan Silvia S14, with the defined hood ridges marking it out as a late-model “Kouki” car and the aggressive rear spoiler suggesting it’s an “Aero” model. This returning car would sit alongside the pre-facelift “Zenki” which was also recently added to the game.

The top-right car is a little more of a challenge to pin down, but it looks to be another new-to-series vehicle: the F87 generation BMW M2. Again it’s not clear from the image alone whether it’s the original M2 or the M2 Competition which replaced it in 2019.

As ever, we don’t know what other content or features this update will bring other than these three cars, though the curious “25th Anniversary” name might tilt fans towards some optimism.

Officially, Gran Turismo won’t be 25 years old until December 23 this year, which makes the update a month early to carry that particular branding. That could of course mean we won’t see a separate update in December, but also suggests there’s more within this update to mark the milestone.

It’s been a while since we’ve seen any new track content, with the most recent being the Catalunya variants, and only Watkins Glen arriving as a wholly new location. With the 2022 Gran Turismo World Series World Final also coming up this week, it would be an ideal time to promote the game with a new circuit.

Fans are also still eagerly anticipating a key game feature, announced by Yamauchi in the game’s early life road map back in March: car selling. That’s yet to see the light of day, and surely can’t be far away.

Although no specific date has been revealed for the update yet, it’s likely that it will arrive on the regular schedule of the final Thursday of the month. That means we can expect it on November 24, which is both Thanksgiving in the USA and the first day of the Gran Turismo World Series World Final. Watch this space for more!
