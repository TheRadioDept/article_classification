It was a big week in Los Angeles, with automakers from all over the world showing off fascinating concepts, new production models, and important brand staples at the California show.

Although it wasn’t the wildest show we can remember, there was no shortage of good stuff to look at. Any rundown of the those events must necessarily start with Porsche, which really went for it and finally showed off the 911 Dakar.

The slowest 911 (in terms of top speed) since the ’80s, as our very own Chris Chilton pointed out, that’s unlikely to prevent this off-road ready production sports car from selling like hot cakes. Powered by the same flat-six as the 911 Carrera 4 GTS, it gets 473 hp (353 kW/480 PS) and an extra 1.2-inches (30 mm) of ground clearance over the regular car. It also costs a whopping $223,450 (including $1,450 for delivery).

But that wasn’t the only interesting production car revealed at the show. The slightly less extreme (but equally inspired by rallying success from decades ago) 2024 Subaru Impreza made its debut, as did the handsome new Toyota Prius, and the 2024 Kia Seltos.

There were also a couple of over-the-top new-energy vehicles, as is customary nowadays, in the form of the 2,000 hp (1,491 kW/2,028 PS) Hydrogen-powered Hyperion XP-1 and the all-electric Drako Dragon, which is an all-electric super SUV that also, coincidentally, makes 2,000 hp (1,491 kW/2,028 PS).

Coming back down to earth, Fiat also had some announcements relating to EVs, saying that it will bring a new version of the 500e to North America in 2024. Hyundai, meanwhile, said that the Ioniq 6 will be priced from around $47,000 and also said it would help its customers set up solar panels, energy storage, and everything they need to turn their home into an EV hub. Genesis, meanwhile, showed off the cocaine-white X Convertible Concept.

And that was just what the OEMs brought to the show. Also present were others like the Galpin family of dealers, which had a whole room of custom and otherwise interesting cars at the show. Check it all out in the gallery below.
