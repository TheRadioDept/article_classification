Samsung’s been releasing the Android 13 and One UI 5.0 update for more and more devices pretty much every other day. Today, the big update has arrived for the Galaxy Z Flip 3. The Z Flip 3’s first stable Android 13 release comes with firmware version F711BXXU3DVK3 and its rollout has started in India, and we have our fingers crossed the rollout will expand to cover more markets over the next few days.

Samsung’s foldables have not received the Android 13/One UI 5.0 upgrade at the same pace as the Galaxy S and Galaxy Note lineups, but it’s good to see the company is beginning to change that. The Galaxy Z Flip 3’s One UI 5.0 update comes on the heels of the update for the Galaxy Z Fold 3. This leaves the Z Fold 2 as the only eligible Samsung foldable to not have been updated, but again, fingers crossed that doesn’t remain the case for too long.

As far as new features are concerned, our YouTube videos that you can check out below will give you a good idea of what to expect. There’s plenty new in One UI 5.0, although there’s not a lot — or anything at all — in the way of features specifically designed for the Galaxy Z Flip line, for those wondering.

The Galaxy Z Flip 3 Android 13 and One UI 5.0 update comes bundled with the November 2022 security patch, and you can download it over the air from the phone’s Settings » Software update menu. The complete firmware is also available in our archives for those who aren’t fond of waiting and are okay with using their PC to upgrade their Galaxy Z Flip 3 (if you take this route, be sure to download the firmware for your specific model and country to avoid any issues).
