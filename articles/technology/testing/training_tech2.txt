How to reach Medali in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet If you've not unlocked any Pokémon Centers near the town yet, the easiest way to reach Medali in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is to travel the main path northeast of Cascarrafa. It'll take you through the Asado Desert and past Port Marinada. It's best to fly to a Pokémon Center as close as possible to here if you can. If you’re getting lost, remember to set Medali as the destination on your map to ensure it appears as a waypoint on your mini-map. Once you’re there, you’ll find the Normal Gym in the middle of the town on the northern edge.
