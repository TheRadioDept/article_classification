If you're looking for early Nintendo Switch deals, this is the one for you. Coming from a slightly unexpected source is the lowest-ever price we've seen on a Switch OLED (by five whole pounds). Yup, ASDA is selling the sought-after Switch OLED for just £279, down from £309 – a delicious saving of £30.

Given the hottest console in town (sorry, PS5) is currently on Amazon for £304, this is quite the deal and we recommend snapping it up post haste. If it sells out, make sure you're following our Nintendo Switch live blog, where we're tracking all the best deals on Switch consoles, bundles, games and accessories as the appear.

With a bigger, brighter screen, the OLED model is worth the extra cash, and thanks to this deal the extra cash is not even that much. Hurrah.

Save £40: If you can't get hold of the above deal on the OLED, Very has another that is just as good. The console along with Nintendo Switch Sports for just £299. Considering the OLED is usually £309 on it's own, this is a cracking deal – and it's selling fast!

SOLD OUT ONLINE Save £30: It's very unusual to see a deal on the OLED console alone, so this offer from Asda should be bought right now (and we don't say that lightly). It's a decent £30 off, which is even better. Have fun.
