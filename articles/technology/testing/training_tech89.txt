The whole reason people are agenst this whole cloud-version idea is because its a lazy way for developers to port their game to the switch. Have a look at Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2. Those could've been ported to the switch by ease. 3 won't run on switch so cloud is the best way in that case.



The Switch is surposed to be portable and no one has good enough wifi to take a cloud version on the go. Not to mention the small % of people who live in a area without wifi or don't have wifi are automatically excluded from playing it.



Cloud versions require a very strong always online internet connection and if for some reason your wifi decides to lock up or freeze. You are going to be kicked from the game, just because of a signal drop.
