The ‘Across the Realms’ side quest in God of War Ragnarok is a tribute

There are a ton of side quests in 2022’s sequel to its iconic first part. Technically, they are called ‘Favors’ that players can complete in order to gain extra points. Plus, they also get to know about the characters in the Norse worlds. One of the most interesting side quests, however, is ‘Across the Realms’, where Mimir tells the story of Jari and Somr’s adventures across the realms.

Handrick wrote that similar to Jari and Somr, they both also traveled across the US to visit Amusement Parks. Moreover, while working together on the PlayStation 5 exclusive, they both wanted to leave a symbol in the game itself to commemorate their bond. Players can find this tribute in the form of a heart-shaped symbol, which was suggested by Snipes.

Sam also revealed that after Snipes passed away, he asked director Eric Williams if they could feature a tribute for him. The team not only added multiple hearts in the entire game but also instilled a separate side quest featuring two men who found each other and the place where they could belong: the Eternal Campfire.
