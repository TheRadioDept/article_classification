Striking Distance Studios has just released an official Launch Trailer for their upcoming spiritual successor to Dead Space, The Callisto Protocol.

The visual fidelity of the footage shown in the trailer is absolutely ridiculous. Characters, animations, lighting, mood, everything looks extremely well polished and absolutely screams AAA game.

The Callisto Protocol transports you to the far future of 2320, where you play as inmate Jacob Lee of the Black Iron prison facility on Jupiter’s eponymous moon, Callisto. As you have probably assumed, something goes very wrong.

If you haven’t heard of The Callisto Protocol yet and are wondering where the connection to the Dead Space franchise stems from, the game is directed by Glen Schofield (and Scott Whitney) who helped develop the 2008 classic. Schofield has since departed Visceral Games to create his own studio, Striking Distance Studios.

Callisto recently made headlines, not only for the also quite impressive gameplay trailer but because the developer decided to self-cancel the game’s Japanese release instead of trying to adhere to the country’s rating board’s standards. You can read all about that here.

If you are already on board the hype train and are looking to immerse yourself in the world of The Callisto Protocol, the developers recently published a six-part Podcast prequel titled Helix Station, starring Emmy-nominated actress Gwendoline Christie and genre fav Michael Ironside.

The Callisto Protocol will launch on December 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

You can take a look at the impressive launch trailer below.
