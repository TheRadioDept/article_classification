50 RTX 4090 GPUs have suffered from melting cable issues globally, and Nvidia now knows the cause of these issues

Nvidia has now released an official statement regarding the widely publicised issues that have affected some GeForce RTX 4090 users, confirming that around 50 users have been affected by the 12VHPWR cable melting phenomenon.

With Nvidia only knowing about 50 or so cases globally, we can conclude that Nvidia's RTX 4090 cable melting issue is not widespread, as Nvidia has reportedly sold well over 100,000 RTX 4090 graphics cards. Nvidia has also stated that their investigation has suggested that incorrect cable insertion is a common issue that has resulted in melted 12VHPWR cables.

Below is Nvidia's official response to gamers who are concerned about their RTX 4090's 12VHPWR cables melting.

We are actively investigating the reports. We are aware of about 50 cases globally.



Our findings to date suggest that a common issue is that connectors are not fully plugged into the graphics card. To help ensure the connector is secure we recommend plugging the power dongle into the graphics card first to ensure it’s firmly and evenly plugged in, before plugging the graphics card into the motherboard.



We are investigating additional ways to ensure that the connector is secure before powering on the graphics card.



NVIDIA and our partners are committed to supporting our customers and ensuring an expedited RMA process, regardless of the cable or card used.
