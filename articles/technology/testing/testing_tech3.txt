My son desperately wanted to try this game, so I give in and bought it digitally from the eShop.

Even he, at 11 years old, was utterly shocked in how terrible this game looks, compared to Pokemon Sword and Legend Arceus which he also played.

I created a guest user on his Switch, so I could give it a go myself and I am just shocked how this game was allowed to release in this state?! I have watched many reviews, so was prepared, but now experiencing it myself. Wow!

The textures are absolutely all over the place. Especially a lot of the terrain textures are even worse than the latest Pokemon games on the 3DS. What in earth happened here? Place holders they had no time to replace?

What is even more shocking! What the hell happened with a lot of the excellent new Pokemon battle move animations they added to Pokemon Sword/Shield?

I catched and tried to fight with lot of different pokemon and most of them haven't even any animations for their moves? Even if they existed in Pokemon Sword/Shield, while that game got critique for lot of animations being basic or absent.

But it's far worse in this game! I thought Scarlet/Violet was built on the same engine as Sword/Shield and they would reuse a lot of the assets/animations for this game. Since all that work has been done already? Makes no sense?!

The overall performance is really bad. So reviewers are right! The game just feels really sluggish, like your character is often walking through the mud. Especially when you are riding around on your Pokemon. Lot of texture pop-in or not appearing at all.

The game world just feels really empty and barren. Boring and bland. Really minimum effort work. Completely soulless.

Next to this, a lot of the quality of life features in from Pokemon Sword/Shield are completely absent in this game?!

You cannot enter any house, hardly any of the NPC's talk to you. The shops are barebones, with no interior (except for the barber), just a pop-up screen with product list. All very low, minimum effort! Place holders again?

Same with the Pokemon centers! Very basic minimum effort design with those. Gass-station design without the shop.

Pokemon Gyms. Tried two of them. Again! Most boring, low effort gyms to date!

Same with Tera lair RAID's. More simplistic lower quality effort, compared to the MAX lair RAID's from Sword/Shield.

This is just a recurring theme with everything in this game. Everything feels minimal effort, basic implementation everywhere. Just all rushed, no polish, no excellence whatsoever.

All in all, it's like they started from complete scratch again, ran out of time and only delivered a very barebones game, with lot of placeholders still in place. Unfinished, buggy, glitchy, worst graphics to date, poor performance, lack of Pokemon battle move animations, etc, etc.

This is the first game I am now sending a refund request to Nintendo Europe (in EU law you have 14 days for full refund).

I immediately got a response that it will take a while to get back to me, as they have an extremely high number of requests right now. Lol! Guess I am not the only one requesting a refund for this unfinished crap!
