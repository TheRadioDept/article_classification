After plunking down $400-$500 on a PlayStation 5 console, you might find your coffers draining oh so quickly after you realize that PS5 video game can cost upwards of $69.99 each. If you've purchased video games at all in the past, you'll probably already realize that patience is well rewarded; video game prices tend to drop substantially after the first year of release. Now that the PS5 has been out for about two years, some of the PS5 launch titles, as well as one title that was released about 6 months later, have finally dropped to 50% or less than their original retail price.

Mind you, these games are PS5 exclusive titles, meaning they're not available for the PS4 console. They were built from the ground up to take advantage of the PS5's graphical power, with no concessions made to make it backwards compatible with legacy consoles. More PS5 exclusive games will be added if we see them go on sale for Black Friday.

Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart

PS5 Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart 50% off $59.99 2 $29.99 See on Amazon

IGN Editor's Choice 9/10 Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is a stunner. It not only gives the latest generation of consoles a game that looks as beautiful as the improved tech promised, but it’s also a fantastic experience to play. Insomniac has been around the Ratchet and Clank block plenty of times before, but Rivet and other new characters add so much charm, wit, and heart to a franchise I’ve loved for most of my life. That’s coupled with series-best action-platforming gameplay and incredible art and sound design across the board. Rift Apart may not be the biggest adventure around, but its big heart, wild weapons, and incredible detail easily make it one of the most memorable of the year so far.

Demon's Souls

PS5 Demon's Souls 59% off $69.99 0 $29.00 See on Amazon

IGN Editor's Choice 9/10 Bluepoint’s team had the unenviable task of remaking an 11-year-old game with a cult following and making it look – and play – the part of being the very first game developed from the ground up for this current generation of consoles. And that’s exactly what they did. Demon’s Souls is breathtakingly gorgeous and plays significantly better than it did on the PS3, not only thanks to the graphical power of the PlayStation 5, but because of smart quality-of-life changes and light touches that modernize some frustrating aspects of the original, without ever sacrificing the relentless challenge, puzzle-infused boss battles, and style that made it such a landmark game in the first place.

Returnal

PS5 Returnal 56% off $69.99 2 $29.99 See on Amazon

IGN 8/10 The moment-to-moment gameplay of Returnal is sublime, with a great selection of weapons that each have a wide variety of interesting possible traits, meaningful strategic decisions that can either keep a run afloat or doom it to sink, and punishingly challenging yet rewarding gunplay that is consistently exhilarating. Even with all of this focus on action, it never drops the ball on the story. Its big issue is that runs last way too long, and there’s no way to save progress outside of putting the PS5 in rest mode. That saps the desire to immediately return and try again after a failure, though not enough to grind it to a halt. Even so, Returnal is an incredible roguelike, and one of Housemarque’s best games to date.
