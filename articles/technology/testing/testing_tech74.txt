The Galaxy S22 Ultra is Samsung’s top-tier smartphone, with a massive screen, built-in S Pen stylus, and advanced cameras. Now you can get a carrier-unlocked model for $900, a discount of $300 from the original price.

Samsung released the Galaxy S22 series earlier this year, and the Ultra model is the best of the bunch. The Ultra is the replacement for Samsung’s old Galaxy Note series, with an S Pen stylus that fits inside the phone when not in use. You also get a large 6.8-inch 120 Hz AMOLED screen, a 5,000mAh battery, IP68 water and dust protection, 8 GB RAM, and 128 GB storage. It shipped with Android 12, but an update to Android 13 is rolling out.

Besides the large screen and S Pen, the main selling point is the array of cameras. The phone has a 12 MP main camera, a 108 MP wide-angle lens, and two 10 MP telephoto (zoom) cameras that offer up to 10x optical zoom. There’s also a 40 MP camera on the front, so video calls and selfies will look fantastic.

This isn’t the first time the Galaxy S22 Ultra has dropped to $800, but it’s still the lowest-recorded price. Amazon and Best Buy both sell the phone as unlocked for use on any carrier, though Best Buy can activate it on a carrier during checkout, if you want.
