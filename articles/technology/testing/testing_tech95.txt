Samsung is red hot with its One UI 5.0 rollout and the latest devices to get the new firmware update are the Galaxy Z Fold3 and Z Flip3 – last year’s flagship foldables from Samsung. Users who were part of the One UI 5 beta program are receiving the firmware update version that ends in DVK3 and we can expect it to spread to more users in the coming days.

As usual, the new update brings the latest November security patch as well as the new Android 13 and Samsung features – the redesigned lockscreen and customization options, more widget options, Bixby Text Call, One UI modes and more. We have detailed coverage of the new features in our announcement news here.
