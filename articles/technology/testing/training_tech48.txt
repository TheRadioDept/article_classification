Does Warhammer 40K Darktide beta progress carry over to the main game‘s release? Like us, you may be wondering if all the work and effort you have put in during the pre-order beta will be worth it in the end and if you can pick up from where you left off on November 30, 2022.

Well, with the Warhammer 40K Darktide release date here, we will take you through what Fatshark have said. That way you will know whether or not you have to start all over again and go through the Warhammer 40K Dartide character creation process a second time.

Does Warhammer 40K Darktide beta progress carry over to the full game?

It seems likely that Warhammer 40K Darktide beta progress will carry over to the full game with Fatshark stating in a blog post that “our goal is to ensure all progression will carry over from the moment you start playing through full release”. However, the studio does say that they cannot guarantee that this will be the case.

This statement is a bit unclear as of right now with Fatshark saying that they can’t guarantee it because they are “still using this period to test our progression systems, and we want to reserve the opportunity to change or reset things in the event something unforeseen or critical happens.” So, it does seem that it is more likely than not that progress will carry over.

We should get an update from Fatshark just before the game releases on November 30, 2022, so we will update this article once the studio gives an update on the progress carrying over.

Now you know if the Warhammer 40K Darktide beta progress carries over to the full game, you can begin testing out the Warhammer 40K Darktide classes to see which one fits your playstyle. Or, you can start crafting a build with our suggestions for the best Warhammer 40K Darktide weapons.
