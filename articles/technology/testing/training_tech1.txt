As you might have already seen, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet comes with a certain glitch that could potentially be used to exploit the game in all sorts of ways. It's essentially the Pokémon equivalent of Super Mario 64's infamous Backwards Long Jump glitch - often abbreviated as BLJ.

This move - closely associated with speedrunning in the 1996 release Super Mario 64, was also spotted in Pokémon Legends: Arceus at launch, and now it's been discovered in Scarlet and Violet. It's as simple as mounting your legendary Koraidon or Miraidon and from there scaling a mountain. You could even potentially speedrun parts of the game. Here's a look:

Centro Pokémon: "A glitch has been discovered in #ScarletViolet that allows scaling early. Normally Koraidon/Miraidon will slip if you try to jump and climb a slope without having the ability, but it turns out it's as simple as jumping back so it doesn't slip."





Normalmente Koraidon/Miraidon se resbalan si intentas brincar y escalar una pendiente sin tener la habilidad, pero resulta que es tan simple como brincar hacia atrás para que no se resbale.

If this does at all concern Game Freak or The Pokémon Company, they could issue a patch. For now, though - it's in the game, and you can probably give it a go yourself, provided you've got a copy of Scarlet or Violet.
