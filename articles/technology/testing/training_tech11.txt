If you're in the market for an excellent, future proofed gaming TV but want to keep your budget to under $1K, then take a look at the TCL 6-series series TV. It has all the technology you'd want in a current generation gaming TV to match your PS5 or Xbox Series X console, and it performs superbly as an HDR TV set as well. Best Buy has the 65" model for $699.99 (normally $1000), which is the lowest price we've seen. It's $100 cheaper than what we saw during Amazon's Early Black Friday sale in October.

The reason the TCL R646 is considerably cheaper compared to other similarly specc'ed TVs is that this is a 2021 model. There is a 2022 variant (the R655), but it's very hard to find and much pricier. The TCL R646 boasts a Mini-LED quantum dot (QLED) panel with full-array LED backlighting and 240-zone local dimming, as well as wide color gamut. That makes it an excellent HDR TV set, especially since it supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+ and HLG.

What's good about "Mini LED", "QLED", and "Local Dimming"?

The QLED panel enables this TV to retain strong color accurary and good dynamic range even at peak brightness levels. The local dimming feature allows different zones to dim or brighten independent of each other, thus allowing the TV to deftly handle scenes where the brightest whites and the darkest blacks occur simultaneously. Mini LED panels allow for even more precising local dimming because the controller zones are smaller and more numerous. Whereas a normal LCD TV with local dimming might have as many as 100 zones of dimming, the TCL R66 boasts a whopping 240 zones.

Why is this a good gaming TV?

The TCL R646 has gamers covered. It has a native 120Hz panel and two HDMI 2.1 inputs. That means it can pass true 4K @ 120Hz on PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles and RTX 30 series equipped gaming PCs. The TCL R646 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR), which is this TV's version of adaptive sync technology, as well as auto low latency mode (ALLM), where the TV automatically switches to a lower latency when it detects gameplay.

Which smart interface does it use?

The 2021 TCL 6-series is also new enough to adopt Google TV for its smart TV experience. Google TV is a definite upgrade to the aging Android TV interface and works just as well as Fire TV or Apple TV, even more so if you use an Android phone or tablet.
