If there's one thing we've noticed in the lead-up to Black Friday, it's that this is the year of the early deal. Black Friday doesn't start until November 25, but you can pick up a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 noise-cancelling headphones for just $228 today, which is the lowest we've ever seen them priced.

What's significant about this deal is that the XM4s are some of the best noise-cancelling headphones you can buy. Sure, they're technically Sony's last-gen noise-cancellers but don't let that fact knock just how good these headphones actually are.

Deal icon An icon in the shape of a lightning bolt. Great Price Sony WH-1000XM4 Sony's WH-1000XM4 are our go-to pair of headphones when we look for a balance, sound quality, noise-cancelling performance, and price. They’re on sale for $228 ahead of Black Friday, which is the lowest price we’ve seen them at. $228.00 from Amazon Originally $348.00 Save 34%

While the latest flagship model WH-1000XM5s do have slightly better sound, it's not significant enough to warrant spending an extra $120 (the XM5s are also on sale right now at the lowest price ever at $348). The XM4s still offer similar battery life, have an incredibly comfortable over-ear design, and deliver rich, quality audio that's made better by its intuitive EQ settings.

What this means is that the sum of the XM4s parts aren't too dissimilar from the XM5 — yet they cost quite a bit less. They're even cheaper right now than the Sony WH-XB910N noise-cancelling headphones, which are easily in a class below.

Put plainly, this is a legitimate steal for one of the most high-quality pairs of headphones you can buy. They're perfect for drowning out noise while working from home (or a local coffee shop) and are a must-have for the frequent traveler.
